## About
My first coding project ever! Yay!
An exercise in taking a given design deck and translating it into html & css.
Note: this project is not responsive

## Successes
- I'm very proud of producing such DRY code so early in my coding journey

## Areas to Improve
- This project did not use a `root font size` & `rem values`
- id links are placed on content, rather than on the section
