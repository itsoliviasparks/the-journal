## About
My first coding project ever! Yay!
An exercise in taking a given design deck and translating it into HTML & CSS.
Note: this project is not responsive

## Successes
- I'm very proud of producing code that follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, which minimizes redundancy and improves maintainability, so early in my coding journey

## Areas to Improve
- This project did not use a `root font size` & `rem values`
- I missplaced the '`id'` links in this project
  - The 'id' links should be placed on the appropriate section elements rather than on content within those sections
