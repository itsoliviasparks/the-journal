## About
An exercise in taking a given design deck and translating it into html & css

## Features
- My first coding project ever! Yay!
- Initial practise in front-end dev skills

## Successes
- I'm very proud of producing such DRY code so early in my coding journey

## Areas to Improve
- This project did not use a root font size & rem values
- id links are placed on content, rather than on the section
- Did not implement responsiveness
